&lt;size=24&gt;"Features"&lt;/size&gt;
This mod adds 5 semi-original fantasy themed metals, that have their own strengths, weaknesses and color, and are dedicated to some of my fellow streamers that have helped me grow. I have attempted to balance them in relation to vanilla ores, as well as comparing them to those found in other mods. The ores are tweaked to be quite rare, but when found, generate in larger quantities. This is done in order to make them useful, but not override to many vanilla (such as steel) and modded (such as iron from materials expanded) spawns for ores that are required in order to build progressing structures and the like.

&lt;size=24&gt;Why did I make this?&lt;/size&gt;
I wanted to make an extension to my fantasy ores mod, where I would dedicate some ore types to other Rimworld streamers, that have helped me grow since I began streaming myself. I quickly realized, that if these were included amongst the other ores, there would likely be too many ore types for most people. Therefor I decided to split it up into its own sub-mod, so that you can opt out of these if you want. That being said, these ores are just as valid additions as the ones from the main mod.

&lt;size=24&gt;What is Included/changed?&lt;/size&gt;
There is a total of 5 ores:
Captolite - Captolamia
Laatim - TeamLogicNL
Keellikoi - KillerKeo
Roosterium - AlexRoosterfield
Tumblum - TumblingSatellite

Each ore also has a color coded texture in 3 sizes, making it easier to distinguish smaller from larger stacks of ores.

&lt;size=24&gt;What this does not do&lt;/size&gt;
There is no added processes, specific buildings or other game mechanics included that expand the use of the metals beyond what the vanilla game, and other mods might do. Nothing is changed, all the ores are just additive, and inherit the baseline properties in the same way that vanilla ores do. There is also no unique texture for each ore (yet), but I would like to make that eventually if I can. Due to the simplicity of this mod, it is quite stackable with other mods, and could even extend them if they dynamically patch in modded ores.

&lt;size=24&gt;How to use this&lt;/size&gt;
Chuck it into your mod load order wherever you think makes the most sense. If you use other mods that can benefit from modded ores, make sure to place this mod according to those mods guidelines.
